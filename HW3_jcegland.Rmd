## Gapminder data 

Generate the graph of LifExp vs. gdpPercap for US, Canada (fixed data) and Australia by RMarkdown based on the data set “gapminder-5060”, like what we did in the class.
Please use Github to collaborate on this problem. For example, one member can create the plot of US in his/her repository. The other member will fork this repository, add the result for the second country, and make a pull request for merging into the main repository. Each member should at least analyze one country and make at least one pull request. Please submit the RMarkdown file, the output file, and the screen shot of the successful pull request and the merge.

## United States Life Expectancy vs gdpPercap 
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data_States = data[data$country=="United States", ]
str(data_States) 

ggplot(data = data_States, aes(x=lifeExp, y=gdpPercap)) + geom_point()



```

## Canada Life Expectancy vs gdpPercap 

***** Ben to do

## Tips to make github easier 

1. Stay in constant communication with your partner 
2. Work in small chunks at a time 
3. Don't forget to commit and push changes 


# Data Science Example 

One example of using data science is in the manufacturing sector. Manufacturers use data science to predict many things such as: 

* Risk minimization  
* Supply chain optimization  
* Analyzing needs of customers  
* Optimally using resources  

The main use of data science in manufacturing is to create forecasts for the demand of certain products. This allows them to optimize supply chains. Optimization makes sure they don't over manufacture or under manufacture any product. The forecast tells them about how much of a product they should make. Data science makes sure that parts are stocked and delivered on time. It considers many factors that influence the process, such as the cost of shipping, weather, material supply, and market scarcity. They can predict the needs and actions of customers and then delegate resources as needed. Without data science in this field, manufacturers wouldn't be able to customize their production around the demand of their customers. It saves their company money, time, and resources. This shows how important data science is to businesses and how they can use data science to make more of a profit.
